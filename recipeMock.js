If you prefer thinner pasta, you can divide the batter into two equal batches, placing on two baking sheets with parchment paper.',
            'Bake each sheet (with parchment paper) for about 10-12 minutes. Set aside to cool. Next, remove the paper and slice pasta into sheets that fit a 9 x 12” (23 x 30 cm) baking dish.',

            'Add water to the mixture, bring to a boil and then lower the heat, and let simmer for at least 15 minutes or until most of the water has evaporated. Since these lasagna sheets don’t soak up as much liquid as traditional ones, the sauce should be on the drier side. Set aside.',

        ],
        notes : 'You can substitute thinly sliced zucchini for the low-carb lasagna sheets. If you don/\'t want the crunchy texture you can place the slices on a baking sheet and sprinkle salt on them. This will draw liquid from the zucchini and make it softer. Instead of ground beef you can use ground pork or poultry. It gives the dish a different but equally great flavor. The ground beef mixture actually tastes better if you make it a day or two ahead of time. You can store it in the fridge for 3-4 days and in the freezer for up to 4 months. Take out from the freezer a day ahead and let thaw in the fridge. The lasagna sheets need to cool completely before placing them in the fridge or freezer.'
